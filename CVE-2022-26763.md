# CVE-2022-26763

This is the DriverKit vulnerability exploited by [Fugu15](https://github.com/pinauten/Fugu15). The `IOPCIDevice::deviceMemoryRead*` and `IOPCIDevice::deviceMemoryWrite*` functions allow specifying an offset which is not checked at all, thereby allowing out-of-bounds access to a PCI device. By specifying an offset that is larger than the PCI device memory size, it becomes possible to read/write arbitrary kernel memory.

The exploit can be found here: [https://github.com/pinauten/Fugu15/tree/master/Exploits/oobPCI/Sources](https://github.com/pinauten/Fugu15/tree/master/Exploits/oobPCI/Sources)
